These are my 7 favorite songs. I intentionally chose more obscure songs because I really like them and I want more people to listen to them (and to seem cooler.) Sorry if the album covers aren't uniformly sized, I don't really care enough to fix it.

#### #1 - Where It'$ At? - Joey Bada$$

This rap album was created when Joey Bada$$ was only 17. I like this song in particular because the beat itself is suprisingly simple-- the same few notes with only some minor variations between them-- making you really appreciate the flow and cadence of the lyrics. 


#### #2 - Never Meant - American Football

This is an absolute staple in the midwest emo genre. Midwest emo is basically just singers crying about losing their first girlfriend using pretentious time-signatures. Never Meant was written in 12/8.

#### #3 - Overslept (feat. mei ehara) - Faye Webster

#### #4 - Excruciating Deth - Machine Girl
#### #5 - Ride on Shooting Star - the pillows
#### #6 - Three Man Weave - Injury Reserve
#### #7 - In The Sink - Plumtree
