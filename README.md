These are my 5 favorite songs. I intentionally chose more obscure songs because I really like them and I want more people to listen to them (and to seem cooler.)

#### #1 - [Where It'$ At? - Joey Bada$$](https://joeybada.bandcamp.com/album/1999)

This rap album was created when Joey Bada$$ was only 17. I like this song in particular because the beat itself is suprisingly simple-- the same few notes with only some minor variations between them-- making you really appreciate the flow and cadence of the lyrics. There's also a sequel to this album, named "2000," which is admittedly not as good.



#### #2 - [Never Meant - American Football](https://americanfootball.bandcamp.com/album/american-football)

I first heard this when I watched a video of [a carton of milk being beat.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJzTThNMEIU) I later kept on hearing it from my phone in middle school after my crush rejected me.

This is an absolute staple in the midwest emo genre. Midwest emo is basically just singers crying about losing their first love using pretentious time-signatures. Never Meant was written in 12/8.



#### #3 - [Overslept (feat. mei ehara) - Faye Webster](https://fayewebster.bandcamp.com/album/i-know-im-funny-haha)

Faye Webster makes me cry. I really enjoyed listening to this while staring at a ceiling fan in a hotel lobby when I first heard it. This is good.



#### #4 - [In The Sink - Plumtree](https://labelobscura.bandcamp.com/album/mass-teen-fainting)

This song was written by the all-teenage-girl band Plumtree, the same band that wrote the song "Scott Pilgrim," which inspired the comic and movie of the same name where the main character dates a high schooler.


#### #5 [Excruciating Deth - Machine Girl](https://machinegirl.bandcamp.com/track/excruciating-deth-phase)

I listen to this song when I do laundry, chores, walk my dog. Machine Girl is an... acquired taste. I think you'd like this song if you have to do jumping jacks doing your homework like me.
